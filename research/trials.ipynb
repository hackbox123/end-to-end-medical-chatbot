This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish\\nlearning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and\\ncommunity. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement\\nthis basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp\\nboundaries between dif ferent subject ar eas. W e hope these measur es will take us significantly\\nfurther in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on\\nEducation (NPE), 1986.\\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to\\nencourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions.\\nWe must r ecognise that, given space, time and fr eedom, childr en generate new knowledge by engaging\\nwith the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis\\nof examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.\\nInculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in\\nlearning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.\\nThese aims imply considerable change i n school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in\\nthe daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the\\nrequired number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching\\nand evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at\\nschool a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried\\nto address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different\\nstages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook\\nattempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for\\ncontemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on\\nexperience.\\nThe National Council of Educational Resear ch and T raining (NCER T) appr eciates the har d\\nwork done by the textbook development committee r esponsible for this book. W e wish to thank the\\nChairperson of the advisory gr oup in science and mathematics, Pr ofessor J.V . Narlikar and the\\nChief Advisor for this book, Pr ofessor A.W . Joshi for guiding the work of this committee. Several\\nteachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for\\nmaking this possible. W e are indebted to the institutions and or ganisations which have gener ously\\npermitted us to draw upon their r esour ces, material and personnel. W e are especially grateful to\\nthe members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary\\nand Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of\\nProfessor Mrinal Miri and Pr ofessor G.P .

In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise\\nthe textbooks across all classes.

It is a natural sequel to the Class XI textbook which\\nwas brought out in 2006. This book is also a trimmed version of the textbooks which existed so\\nfar. The chapter on ther mal and chemical ef fects of curr ent has been cut out. This topic has also\\nbeen dropped from the CBSE syllabus. Similarly, the chapter on communications has been\\nsubstantially curtailed. It has been rewritten in an easily comprehensible form.\\nAlthough most other chapters have been based on the earlier versions, several parts and\\nsections in them have been rewritten. The Development Team has been guided by the feedback\\nreceived from innumerable teachers across the country.\\nIn producing these books, Class XI as well as Class XII, there has been a basic change of\\nemphasis. Both the books present physics to students without assuming that they would pursue\\nthis subject beyond the higher secondary level. This new view has been prompted by the various\\nobservations and suggestions made in the National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005.\\nSimilarly, in today’s educational scenario where students can opt for various combinations of\\nsubjects, we cannot assume that a physics student is also studying mathematics. Therefore,\\nphysics has to be presented, so to say, in a standalone form.\\nAs in Class XI textbook, some interesting box items have been inserted in many chapters.\\nThey are not meant for teaching or examinations. Their purpose is to catch the attention of the\\nreader , to show some applications in daily life or in other ar eas of science and technology, to\\nsuggest a simple experiment, to show connection of concepts in different areas of physics, and\\nin general, to break the monotony and enliven the book.\\nFeatur es like Summary, Points to Ponder , Exer cises and Additional Exer cises at the end of\\neach chapter , and Examples have been r etained. Several concept-based Exer cises have been\\ntransferred from end-of-chapter Exercises to Examples with Solutions in the text. It is hoped\\nthat this will make the concepts discussed in the chapter more comprehensible. Several new\\nexamples and exercises have been added. Students wishing to pursue physics further would\\nfind Points to Ponder and Additional Exercises very useful and thoughtful. To provide resources\\nbeyond the textbook  and to encourage eLear ning, each chapter has been pr ovided with\\nsome relevant website addresses under the title ePhysics . These sites provide additional\\nmaterial on specific topics and also provide learners with opportunites for interactive\\ndemonstrations/experiments.\\nThe intricate concepts of physics must be understood, comprehended and appreciated.\\nStudents must learn to ask questions like ‘why’, ‘how’, ‘how do we know it’. They will find\\nalmost always that the question ‘why’ has no answer within the domain of physics and science\\nin general. But that itself is a learning experience, is it not? On the other hand, the question\\n‘how’ has been reasonably well answered by physicists in the case of most natural phenomena.\\nIn fact, with the understanding of how things happen, it has been possible to make use of many\\nphenomena to create technological applications for the use of humans.\\nFor example, consider statements in a book, like ‘A negatively charged electron is attracted\\nby the positively charged plate’, or ‘In this experiment, light (or electron) behaves like a wave’.\\nYou will r ealise that it is not possible to answer ‘why’. This question belongs to the domain of\\nphilosophy or metaphysics. But we can answer ‘how’, we can find the force acting, we can find\\n2024-25\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

The feedback and\\ncritical look provided by higher secondary teachers in the various teams are highly laudable.\\nMost box items were generated by members of one or the other team, but three of them were\\ngenerated by friends and well-wishers not part of any team.

Many such pairs of materials wer e known which\\non rubbing could attract light objects like straw, pith balls and bits of\\npapers.\\nIt was observed that if two glass rods rubbed with wool or silk cloth\\nare brought close to each other , they r epel each other [Fig. 1.1(a)]. The\\ntwo strands of wool or two pieces of silk cloth, with which the rods were\\nrubbed, also r epel each other . However , the glass r od and wool attracted\\neach other . Similarly, two plastic r ods rubbed with cat’s fur r epelled each\\nother [Fig. 1.1(b)] but attracted the fur . On the other hand, the plastic\\nrod attracts the glass rod [Fig. 1.1(c)] and repel the silk or wool with\\nwhich the glass r od is rubbed. The glass r od repels the fur .\\nThese seemingly simple facts  were established from years of efforts\\nand careful experiments and their analyses. It was concluded, after many\\ncareful studies by different scientists, that there were only two kinds of\\nan entry which is called the electric char ge. We say that the bodies like\\nglass or plastic rods, silk, fur and pith balls are electrified. They acquire\\nan electric charge on rubbing. T here are two kinds of electrification and\\nwe find  that (i) like charges repel  and (ii) unlike charges  attract  each\\nother . The pr operty which dif ferentiates the two kinds of char ges is called\\nthe polarity  of charge.\\nWhen a glass rod is rubbed with silk, the rod acquires one kind of\\ncharge and the silk acquires the second kind of charge. This is true for\\nany pair of objects that are rubbed to be electrified. Now if the electrified\\nglass rod is brought in contact with silk, with which it was rubbed, they\\nno longer attract each other . They also do not attract or r epel other light\\nobjects as they did on being electrified.\\nThus, the charges acquired after rubbing are lost when the charged\\nbodies are brought in contact. What can you conclude from these\\nobservations? It just tells us that unlike charges acquired by the objects\\nneutralise or nullify each other’s effect. Therefore, the charges were named\\nas positive  and negative  by the American scientist Benjamin Franklin.\\nBy convention, the charge on glass rod or cat’s fur is called positive and\\nthat on plastic rod or silk is termed negative. If an object possesses an\\nelectric charge, it is said to be electrified or charged. When it has no charge\\nit is said to be electrically neutral.FIGURE  1.1 Rods: like char ges repel and unlike char ges attract each other .\\n2024-25\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

It consists of a vertical metal rod housed in a\\nbox, with two thin gold leaves attached to its bottom end. When a charged\\nobject touches the metal knob at the top of the rod, charge flows on to\\nthe leaves and they diverge. The degree of divergance is an indicator of\\nthe amount of charge.\\nTry to understand why material bodies acquir e char ge. You know that\\nall matter is made up of atoms and/or molecules. Although normally the\\nmaterials are electrically neutral,  they do contain charges; but their charges\\nare exactly balanced. For ces that hold the molecules together , forces that\\nhold atoms together in a solid, the adhesive force of glue, forces associated\\nwith surface tension, all are basically electrical in nature, arising from the\\nforces between charged particles. Thus the electric force is all pervasive and\\nit encompasses almost each and every field associated with our life. It is\\ntherefore essential that we learn more about such a force.\\nTo electrify a neutral body, we need to add or remove one kind of\\ncharge. When we say that a body is charged, we always refer to this\\nexcess charge or deficit of charge. In solids,  some of the electrons, being\\nless tightly bound in the atom, are the charges which are transferred\\nfrom one body to the other .  A body can thus be char ged positively by\\nlosing some of its electrons. Similarly, a body can be charged negatively\\nby gaining electrons. When we rub a glass rod with silk, some of the\\nelectrons from the rod are transferred to the silk cloth. Thus the rod gets\\npositively charged and the silk gets negatively charged. No new charge is\\ncreated in the process of rubbing. Also the number of electrons, that are\\ntransferred, is a very small fraction of the total number of electrons in the\\nmaterial body.\\n1.3  C ONDUCTORS  AND INSULA TORS\\nSome substances readily allow passage of electricity through them, others\\ndo not.  Those which allow electricity to pass through them easily are\\ncalled conductors . They have electric charges (electrons) that are\\ncomparatively free to move inside the material. Metals, human and animal\\nbodies and earth are conductors. Most of the non-metals like glass,\\nporcelain, plastic, nylon, wood offer high resistance to the passage of\\nelectricity through them. They are called insulators . Most  substances\\nfall into one of the two classes stated above *.\\nWhen some char ge is transferr ed to a conductor , it r eadily gets\\ndistributed over the entir e sur face of the conductor . In contrast, if some\\ncharge is put on an insulator , it stays at the same place. Y ou will lear n\\nwhy this happens in the next chapter .\\nThis property of the materials tells you why a nylon or plastic comb\\ngets electrified on combing dry hair or on rubbing, but a metal article\\n*There is a third category called semiconductors , which offer resistance to the\\nmovement of charges which is intermediate between the conductors and\\ninsulators.\\n2024-25\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

The charges on metal leak through\\nour body to the ground as both are conductors of\\nelectricity. However , if a metal r od with a wooden or plastic\\nhandle is rubbed without touching its metal part, it shows\\nsigns of charging.\\n1.4  B ASIC PROPERTIES  OF ELECTRIC\\nCHARGE\\nWe have seen that ther e are two types of char ges, namely\\npositive and negative and their effects tend to cancel each\\nother . Here,  we shall now describe some other pr operties\\nof the electric charge.\\nIf the sizes of charged bodies are very small as\\ncompared to the distances between them, we treat them\\nas point charges . All the charge content of the body is\\nassumed to be concentrated at one point in space .\\n1.4.1  Additivity of charges\\nWe have not as yet given a quantitative definition of a\\ncharge; we shall follow it  up in the next section. W e shall\\ntentatively assume that this can be done and proceed. If\\na system contains two point charges q1 and q2, the total\\ncharge of the system is obtained simply by adding\\nalgebraically q1 and q2 , i.e., charges add up like real numbers or they\\nare scalars like the mass of a body. If a system contains n charges q1,\\nq2, q3, …, qn, then the total charge of the system is q1 + q2 + q3 + … + qn\\n.  Char ge has  magnitude but no dir ection, similar to mass. However ,\\nthere is one difference between mass and charge. Mass of a body is\\nalways positive whereas a charge can be either positive or negative.\\nProper signs have to be used while adding the charges in a system. For\\nexample, the total charge of a system containing five charges +1, +2, –3,\\n+4 and –5, in some arbitrary unit, is (+1) + (+2) + (–3) + (+4) + (–5) = –1 i n\\nthe same unit.\\n1.4.2  Charge is conserved\\nWe have alr eady  hinted to the fact that when bodies ar e char ged by\\nrubbing, there is transfer of electrons from one body to the other; no new\\ncharges are either created or destroyed. A picture of particles of electric\\ncharge enables us to understand the idea of conservation of charge. When\\nwe rub two bodies, what one body gains in charge the other body loses.\\nWithin an isolated system consisting of many charged bodies, due to\\ninteractions among the bodies, charges may get redistributed but it is\\nfound that the total charge of the isolated system is always conserved .\\nConservation of charge has been established experimentally.\\nIt is not possible to create or destroy net charge carried by any isolated\\nsystem although the charge carrying particles may be created or destroyedFIGURE  1.2 Electroscopes: (a)\\nThe gold leaf electroscope, (b)\\nSchematics of a simple\\nelectroscope.\\n2024-25\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

Sometimes nature creates charged particles: a neutron turns\\ninto a proton and an electron. The proton and electron thus create d have\\nequal and opposite charges and the total charge is zero before and after\\nthe creation.\\n1.4.3  Quantisation of charge\\nExperimentally it is established that all free charges are integral multiples\\nof a basic unit of charge denoted by e. Thus charge q on a body is always\\ngiven by\\nq = ne\\nwher e n is any integer , positive or negative. This basic unit of char ge is\\nthe charge that an electron or proton carries. By convention, the charge\\non an electron is taken to be negative; therefore charge on an electron is\\nwritten as –e and that on a proton as +e.\\nThe fact that electric charge is always an integral multiple of e  is termed\\nas quanti sation of charge . There are a large number of situations in physics\\nwhere certain physical quantities are quanti sed. The quanti sation of charge\\nwas first suggested by the experimental laws of electrolysis discovered by\\nEnglish experimentalist Faraday. It was experimentally demonstrated by\\nMillikan in 1912.\\nIn the International System (SI) of Units, a unit of charge is called a\\ncoulomb  and is denoted by the symbol C. A coulomb is defined in terms\\nthe unit of the electric current which you are going to learn in a\\nsubsequent chapter . In ter ms of this definition, one coulomb is the char ge\\nflowing through a wire in 1 s if the current is 1 A (ampere), (see Chapter 1\\nof Class XI, Physics Textbook , Part I). In this system, the value of the\\nbasic unit of charge is\\ne = 1.602192 × 10–19 C\\nThus, there are about 6 × 1018 electrons in a charge of  –1C. In\\nelectrostatics, charges of this large magnitude are seldom  encountered\\nand hence we use smaller units 1 mC (micro coulomb) = 10–6 C or 1 mC\\n(milli coulomb) = 10–3 C.\\nIf the protons and electrons are the only basic charges in the\\nuniverse, all the observable charges have to be integral multiples of e.\\nThus, if a body contains n1 electrons and n2 protons, the total amount\\nof charge on the body is n2 × e + n1 × (–e) = (n2 – n1) e. Since n1 and n2\\nare integers, their dif ference is also an integer . Thus the char ge on any\\nbody is always an integral multiple of e and can be increased or\\ndecreased also in steps of e.\\nThe step size e is, however , very small because at the macr oscopic\\nlevel, we deal with charges of a few mC. At this scale the fact that charge of\\na body can increase or decrease in units of e is not visible. In this respect,\\nthe grainy nature of the charge is lost and it appears to be continuous.\\nThis situation can be compared with the geometrical concepts of points\\nand lines. A dotted line viewed from a distance appears continuous to\\nus but is not continuous in reality. As many points very close to\\n2024-25\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

Since e = 1.6 × 10–19 C, a charge\\nof magnituOde, say 1 mC, contains something like 1013 times the electronic\\ncharge. At this scale, the fact that charge can increase or decrease only in\\nunits of e is not very different from saying that charge can take continuous\\nvalues. Thus, at the macroscopic level, the quantisation of charge has no\\npractical consequence and can be ignor ed. However , at the micr oscopic\\nlevel, where the charges involved are of the order of a few tens or hundreds\\nof e, i.e.,  they can be counted, they appear in discrete lumps and\\nquantisation of charge cannot be ignored. It is the magnitude of scale\\ninvolved that is very important.\\nExample 1.1  If 109 electrons move out of a body to another body\\nevery second, how much time is required to get a total charge of 1 C\\non the other body?\\nSolution  In one second 109 electrons move out of the body. Therefore\\nthe charge given out in one second is 1.6 × 10–19 × 109 C = 1.6 × 10–10 C.\\nThe time required to accumulate a charge of 1 C can then be estimated\\nto be 1 C ÷ (1.6 × 10–10 C/s) = 6.25 × 109 s = 6.25 × 109 ÷ (365  × 24 ×\\n3600) years = 198 years. Thus to collect a charge of one coulomb,\\nfrom a body from which 109 electrons move out every second, we will\\nneed approximately 200 years. One coulomb is, therefore, a very large\\nunit for many practical purposes.\\nIt is, however , also important to know what is r oughly the number of\\nelectrons contained in a piece of one cubic centimetre of a material.\\nA cubic piece of copper of side 1 cm contains about 2.5 × 1024\\nelectrons.\\nExample 1.2 How much positive and negative charge is there in a\\ncup of water?\\nSolution  Let us assume that the mass of one cup of water is\\n250 g. The molecular mass of water is 18g. Thus, one mole\\n(= 6.02 × 1023 molecules) of water is 18 g. Therefore the number of\\nmolecules in one cup of water is (250/18) × 6.02 × 1023.\\nEach molecule of water contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen\\natom, i.e., 10 electrons and 10 protons. Hence the total positive and\\ntotal negative charge has the same magnitude. It is equal to\\n(250/18) × 6.02 × 1023 × 10 × 1.6 × 10–19 C = 1.3 4 × 107 C.\\n1.5  C OULOMB ’S LAW\\nCoulomb’s law is a quantitative statement about the force between two\\npoint charges. When the linear size of charged bodies are much smaller\\nthan the distance separating them, the size may be ignored and the\\ncharged bodies are treated as point charges . Coulomb measured the\\nforce between two point charges and found that it varied inversely as\\nthe square of the distance between the charges and was directly\\nproportional to the product of the magnitude of the two charges and\\n2024-25\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

Thus, if two\\npoint charges q1, q2 are separated by a distance r in vacuum,\\nthe magnitude of the force ( F) between them is given by\\n2 1\\n2q qF kr= (1.1)\\nHow did Coulomb arrive at this law from his experiments?\\nCoulomb used a torsion balance *  for measuring the force\\nbetween two charged metallic spheres. When the separation\\nbetween two spheres is much larger than the radius of each\\nsphere, the charged spheres may be regarded as point charges.\\nHowever , the char ges on the spher es wer e unknown, to begin\\nwith. How then could he discover a relation like Eq. (1.1)?\\nCoulomb thought of the following simple way: Suppose the\\ncharge on a metallic sphere is q. If the sphere is put in contact\\nwith an identical uncharged sphere, the charge will spread over\\nthe two spheres. By symmetry, the charge on each sphere will\\nbe q/2*. Repeating this process, we can get charges q/2, q/4,\\netc. Coulomb varied the distance for a fixed pair of charges and\\nmeasured the force for different separations. He then varied the\\ncharges in pairs, keeping the distance fixed for each pair .\\nComparing forces for different pairs of  charges at different\\ndistances, Coulomb arrived at the relation, Eq. (1.1).\\nCoulomb’s law, a simple mathematical statement,  was\\ninitially experimentally arrived at  in the manner described\\nabove. While the original experiments established it at a\\nmacroscopic scale, it has also been established down to\\nsubatomic level  ( r ~ 10–10 m).\\nCoulomb discovered his law without knowing the explicit\\nmagnitude of the charge. In fact, it is the other way round:\\nCoulomb’s law can now be employed to furnish a definition\\nfor a unit of charge. In the relation, Eq. (1.1), k is so far\\narbitrary. W e can choose any positive value of k. The choice\\nof k determines the size of the unit of charge. In SI units, the\\nvalue of k is about 9 × 109 2\\n2Nm\\nC. The unit of charge that\\nresults from this choice is called a coulomb which we defined\\nearlier in Section 1.4. Putting this value of k in Eq. (1.1), we\\nsee that for q1 = q2 = 1 C, r = 1 m\\nF = 9 × 109 N\\nThat is, 1 C is the charge that when placed at a distance\\nof 1 m from another charge of the same magnitude in vacuum\\nexperiences an electrical force of repulsion of magnitude\\n*A torsion balance is a sensitive device to measure force. It was also used later\\nby Cavendish to measure the very feeble gravitational force between two objects,\\nto verify Newton’s Law of Gravitation.\\n*Implicit in this is the assumption of additivity of charges and conservation:\\ntwo charges ( q/2 each) add up to make a total charge  q.Charles Augustin de\\nCoulomb (1736 – 1806)\\nCoulomb, a French\\nphysicist, began his\\ncareer as a military\\nengineer in the W est\\nIndies. In 1776, he\\nreturned to Paris and\\nretired to a small estate\\nto do his scientific\\nresearch. He invented a\\ntorsion balance to\\nmeasure the quantity of\\na force and used it for\\ndetermination of forces\\nof electric attraction or\\nrepulsion between small\\ncharged spheres. He\\nthus arrived in 1785 at\\nthe inverse square law\\nrelation, now known as\\nCoulomb’s law.

If we\\nplace another point char ge q at a point P , wher e OP = r, then the char ge Q\\nwill exert a for ce on q as per Coulomb’s law. W e may ask the question: If\\ncharge q is removed, then what is left in the surrounding? Is there\\nnothing? If ther e is nothing at the point P , then how does a for ce act\\nwhen we place the char ge q at P. In or der to answer such questions, the\\nearly scientists introduced the concept of field. According to this, we say\\nthat the charge Q produces an electric field everywhere in the surrounding.\\nWhen another char ge q is brought at some point P , the field ther e acts on\\nit and produces a force. The electric field produced by the charge Q  at a\\npoint r is given as\\nE r r r ()= =1\\n41\\n402\\n02π πε εQ\\nrQ\\nrˆ ˆ(1.6)\\nwhere ˆ=r r/r, is a unit vector fr om the origin to the point r. Thus, Eq.(1.6)\\nspecifies the value of the electric field for each value of the position\\nvector r. The wor d “field” signifies how some distributed quantity (which\\ncould be a scalar or a vector) varies with position. The effect of the charge\\nhas been incorporated in the existence of the electric field. W e obtain the\\nforce F exerted by a charge  Q on a charge q, as\\nF r =1\\n402πεQq\\nrˆ(1.7)\\nNote that the charge q also exerts an equal and opposite force on the\\ncharge Q. The electrostatic force between the charges Q and q can be\\nlooked upon as an interaction between charge q and the electric field of\\nQ and vice versa. If we denote the position of char ge q by the vector r, it\\nexperiences a force F equal to the charge q multiplied by the electric\\nfield E at the location of q. Thus,\\nF(r) = q E(r) (1.8)\\nEquation (1.8) defines the SI unit of electric field as N/C *.\\nSome important remarks may be made here:\\n(i)From Eq.

The charge Q, which is producing the electric field, is\\ncalled a source charge  and the charge q, which tests the effect of a\\nsource charge, is called a test charge . Note that the source charge Q\\nmust r emain at its original location. However , if a char ge q is brought\\nat any point around  Q, Q itself is bound to experience an electrical\\nforce due to q and will tend to move. A way out of this difficulty is to\\nmake q negligibly small. The force F is then negligibly small but the\\nratio F/q is finite and defines the electric field:\\nEF=\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8ed\\uf8ec\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f8\\uf8f7→lim\\nq q0(1.9)\\nA practical way to get around the problem (of keeping Q undisturbed\\nin the presence of q) is to hold Q to its location by unspecified forces!\\nThis may look strange but actually this is what happens in practice.\\nWhen we are considering the electric force on a test charge q due to a\\ncharged planar sheet (Section 1.14), the charges on the sheet are held to\\ntheir locations by the forces due to the unspecified charged constituents\\ninside the sheet.\\n(ii)Note that the electric field E due to Q, though defined operationally in\\nterms of some test charge q, is independent of q. This is because\\nF is proportional to q, so the ratio F/q does not depend on q. The\\nforce F on the charge q due to the charge Q depends on the particular\\nlocation of charge q which may take any value in the space around\\nthe charge Q. Thus, the electric field E due to Q is also dependent on\\nthe space coor dinate r. For dif ferent positions of the char ge q all over\\nthe space , we get different values of electric field E. The field exists at\\nevery point in three-dimensional space.\\n(iii)For a positive charge, the electric field will be directed radially\\noutwards from the charge. On the other hand, if the source charge is\\nnegative, the electric field vector , at each point, points radially inwar ds.\\n(iv)Since the magnitude of the force F on charge q due to charge Q\\ndepends only on the distance r of the charge q from charge Q,\\nthe magnitude of the electric field E will also depend only on the\\ndistance r. Thus at equal distances fr om the char ge Q, the magnitude\\nof its electric field E is same.  The magnitude of electric field E due to\\na point charge is thus same on a sphere with the point charge at its\\ncentre; in other words, it has a spherical symmetry.\\n1.7.1  Electric field due to a system of charges\\nConsider a system of charges q1, q2, ..., qn with  position vectors r1,\\nr2, ..., rn relative  to some origin O. Like the electric field at a point in\\nspace due to a single charge, electric field at a point in space due to the\\nsystem of charges is defined to be the force experienced by a unit\\ntest charge placed at that point, without disturbing the original\\npositions of char ges q1, q2, ...,\\n qn.

After all, for any system of charges, the measurable quantity\\nis the force on a charge which can be directly determined using Coulomb’s\\nlaw and the superposition principle [Eq. (1.5)]. Why then introduce this\\nintermediate quantity called the electric field?\\nFor electrostatics, the concept of electric field is convenient, but not\\nreally necessary. Electric field is an elegant way of characterising the\\nelectrical environment of a system of charges. Electric field at a point in\\nthe space around a system of charges tells you the force a unit positive\\ntest charge would experience if placed at that point (without disturbing\\nthe system). Electric field is a characteristic of the system of charges and\\nis independent of the test charge that you place at a point to determine\\nthe field. The term field in physics generally refers to a quantity that is\\ndefined at every point in space and may vary from point to point. Electric\\nfield is a vector field, since force is a vector quantity.\\nThe true physical significance of the concept of electric field, however ,\\nemerges only when we go beyond electrostatics and deal with time-\\ndependent electromagnetic phenomena. Suppose we consider the force\\nbetween two distant charges q1, q2 in accelerated motion. Now the greatest\\nspeed with which a signal or information can go from one point to another\\nis c, the speed of light. Thus, the effect of any motion of q1 on q2 cannotFIGURE  1.9 Electric field at a point\\ndue to a system of charges is the\\nvector sum of the electric fields at\\nthe point due to individual charges.\\n2024-25\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

There will be some time delay between the effect\\n(force on q2) and the cause (motion of q1). It is precisely here that the\\nnotion of electric field (strictly, electromagnetic field) is natural and very\\nuseful. The field picture is this: the accelerated motion of charge q1\\nproduces electromagnetic waves, which then propagate with the speed\\nc, reach q2 and cause a force on q2. The notion of field elegantly accounts\\nfor the time delay. Thus, even though electric and magnetic fields can be\\ndetected only by their effects (forces) on charges, they are regarded as\\nphysical entities, not merely mathematical constructs. They have an\\nindependent dynamics of their own,  i.e., they evolve according to laws\\nof their own. They can also transport energy. Thus, a source of time-\\ndependent electromagnetic fields, turned on for a short interval of time\\nand then switched off, leaves behind propagating electromagnetic fields\\ntransporting energy. The concept of field was first introduced by Faraday\\nand is now among the central concepts in physics.\\nExample 1.7 An electron falls through a distance of 1.5 cm in a\\nuniform electric field of magnitude 2.0 × 104 N C–1 [Fig. 1.10(a)].

It is a vector quantity\\nand can be represented as we represent vectors. Let us try to represent E\\ndue to a point charge pictorially. Let the point charge be placed at the\\norigin. Draw vectors pointing along the direction of the\\nelectric field with their lengths proportional to the strength\\nof the field at each point. Since the magnitude of electric\\nfield at a point decreases inversely as the square of the\\ndistance of that point from the charge, the vector gets\\nshorter as one goes away from the origin, always pointing\\nradially outward. Figure 1.12 shows such a picture.  In\\nthis figure, each arrow indicates the electric field, i.e., the\\nforce acting on a unit positive charge, placed at the tail of\\nthat arrow.  Connect the arrows pointing in one direction\\nand the r esulting figur e represents a field line. W e thus\\nget many field lines, all pointing outwards from the point\\ncharge. Have we lost the information about the strength\\nor magnitude of the field now, because it was contained\\nin the length of the arrow? No. Now the magnitude of the\\nfield is represented by the density of field lines. E is strong\\nnear the charge, so the density of field lines is more near\\nthe char ge and the lines ar e closer . Away fr om the char ge,\\nthe field gets weaker and the density of field lines is less,\\nresulting in well-separated lines.\\nAnother person may draw more lines. But the number of lines is not\\nimportant. In fact, an infinite number of lines can be drawn in any region.FIGURE  1.12 Field of a point charge. EXAMPLE  1.8\\n2024-25\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

So if one wishes\\nto estimate the density of field lines, one has to consider the\\nnumber of lines per unit cross-sectional area, perpendicular\\nto the lines.  Since the electric field decreases as the square of\\nthe distance from a point charge and the area enclosing the\\ncharge increases as the square of the distance, the number\\nof field lines crossing the enclosing area remains constant,\\nwhatever may be the distance of the area from the charge.\\nWe started by saying that the field lines carry infor mation\\nabout the direction of electric field at different points in space.\\nHaving drawn a certain set of field lines, the relative density\\n(i.e., closeness) of the field lines at different points indicates\\nthe relative strength of electric field at those points. The field\\nlines crowd where the field is strong and are spaced apart\\nwher e it is weak. Figur e 1.13 shows a set of field lines. W e\\ncan imagine two equal and small elements of area placed at points R and\\nS normal to the field lines there. The number of field lines in our picture\\ncutting the area elements is proportional to the magnitude of field at\\nthese points. The picture shows that the field at R is stronger than at S.\\nTo understand the dependence of the field lines on the area, or rather\\nthe solid angle subtended by an area element, let us try to relate the\\narea with the solid angle, a generalisation of angle to three dimensions.\\nRecall how a (plane) angle is defined in two-dimensions. Let a small\\ntransverse line element Dl  be placed at a distance r  from a point O. Then\\nthe angle subtended by Dl  at O can be appr oximated as Dq = Dl/r.\\nLikewise, in three-dimensions the solid angle * subtended by a small\\nperpendicular plane ar ea DS, at a distance r, can be written as\\nDW = DS/r2. We know that in a given solid angle the number of radial\\nfield lines is the same. In Fig. 1.13, for two points P1 and P2 at distances\\nr1 and r2 from the charge, the element of area subtending the solid angle\\nDW is 2\\n1rDW at P1 and an element of area 2\\n2rDW at P2, respectively. The\\nnumber of lines (say n) cutting these area elements are the same. The\\nnumber of field lines, cutting unit area element is therefore n/(2\\n1rDW) at\\nP1 and n/(2\\n2rDW) at P2, respectively. Since n and DW are common, the\\nstrength of the field clearly has a 1/ r2 dependence.\\nThe picture of field lines was invented by Faraday to develop an\\nintuitive non-mathematical way of visualising electric fields around\\ncharged configurations. Faraday called them lines of for ce. This ter m is\\nsomewhat misleading, especially in case of magnetic fields. The more\\nappr opriate ter m is field lines  (electric or magnetic) that we have\\nadopted in this book.\\nElectric field lines are thus a way of pictorially mapping the electric\\nfield around a configuration of charges. An electric field line is, in general,FIGURE  1.13  Dependence of\\nelectric field strength on the\\ndistance and its relation to the\\nnumber of field lines.\\n*Solid angle is a measure of a cone. Consider the intersection of the given cone\\nwith a sphere of radius R. The solid angle DW of the cone is defined to be equal\\nto DS/R2, where DS is the area on the sphere cut out by the cone.\\n2024-25\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

The\\nrate of flow of liquid is given by the volume crossing the\\narea per unit time  v dS and represents the flux of liquid\\nflowing across the plane. If the normal to the surface is\\nnot parallel to the direction of flow of liquid, i.e., to v , but\\nmakes an angle q with it, the projected area in a plane\\nperpendicular to v is δdS cos q. Therefore, the flux going\\nout of the surface d S is v.ˆndS. For the case of  the electric\\nfield, we define an analogous quantity and call it electric\\nflux. We should, however , note that ther e is no flow of a\\nphysically observable quantity unlike the case of\\nliquid flow.\\nIn the picture of electric field lines described above,\\nwe saw that the number of field lines crossing a unit area,\\nplaced normal to the field at a point is a measure of the\\nstrength of electric field at that point.

Now\\nsuppose we tilt the area element by angle q.\\nClearly, the number of field lines crossing the\\narea element will be smaller . The pr ojection of\\nthe area element normal to E is DS cos q. Thus,\\nthe number of field lines crossing DS is\\nproportional to E DS cos q. When q = 90°, field\\nlines will be parallel to DS and will not cross it\\nat all (Fig. 1.15).\\nThe orientation of area element and not\\nmerely its magnitude is important in many\\ncontexts. For example, in a stream, the amount\\nof water flowing through a ring will naturally\\ndepend on how you hold the ring. If you hold\\nit normal to the flow, maximum water will flow\\nthrough it than if you hold it with some other\\norientation. This shows that an area element\\nshould be tr eated as a vector . It has a\\nmagnitude and also a direction. How to specify the direction of a planar\\narea? Clearly, the normal to the plane specifies the orientation of the\\nplane. Thus the direction of a planar area vector is along its normal.\\nHow to associate a vector to the ar ea of a curved sur face? W e imagine\\ndividing the surface into a large number of very small area elements.\\nEach small area element may be treated as planar and a vector associated\\nwith it, as explained before.\\nNotice one ambiguity here. The direction of an area element is along\\nits normal. But a normal can point in two directions. Which direction do\\nwe choose as the direction of the vector associated with the area element?\\nThis problem is resolved by some convention appropriate to the given\\ncontext. For the case of a closed surface, this convention is very simple.\\nThe vector associated with every area element of a closed surface is taken\\nto be in the direction of the outward  normal. This is the convention used\\nin Fig. 1.16. Thus, the area element vector DS at a point on a closed\\nsurface equals DS ˆn where D S is the magnitude of the area element and\\nˆn is a unit vector in the direction of outward normal at that point.\\nWe now come to the definition of electric flux. Electric flux Df through\\nan area element DS is defined by\\nDf = E.DS = E DS  cos q (1.11)\\nwhich, as seen before, is proportional to the number of field lines cutting\\nthe area element. The angle q here is the angle between E and DS. For a\\nclosed surface, with the convention stated already, q is the angle between\\nE and the outward normal   to the area element. Notice we could look at\\nthe expression E DS cos q  in two ways:  E ( DS cos q ) i.e., E times theFIGURE  1.15  Dependence of flux on the\\ninclination q between E and ˆn.\\nFIGURE  1.16\\nConvention for\\ndefining normal\\nˆn and DS. *It will not be proper to say that the number of field lines is equal to E DS. The\\nnumber of field lines is after all, a matter of how many field lines we choose to\\ndraw.

The line connecting the two charges defines\\na direction in space. By convention, the direction from – q to q is said to\\nbe the direction of the dipole. The mid-point of locations of – q and q is\\ncalled the centre of the dipole.\\nThe total charge of the electric dipole is obviously zero. This does not\\nmean that the field of the electric dipole is zero. Since the charge q and\\n–q are separated by some distance, the electric fields due to them, when\\nadded, do not exactly cancel out. However , at distances much lar ger than\\nthe separation of the two charges forming a dipole ( r >> 2 a), the fields\\ndue to q and – q nearly cancel out. The electric field due to a dipole\\ntherefore falls off, at large distance, faster than like 1/ r2 (the dependence\\non r of the field due to a single charge q). These qualitative ideas are\\nborne out by the explicit calculation as follows:\\n1.10.1  The field of an electric dipole\\nThe electric field of the pair of charges (– q and q) at any point in space\\ncan be found out from Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle.\\nThe results are simple for the following two cases: (i) when the point is on\\nthe dipole axis, and (ii) when it is in the equatorial plane  of the dipole,\\ni.e.,  on a plane perpendicular to the dipole axis through its centre.

(By permanent dipole, we\\nmean that p exists  irrespective of E; it has not been induced by E.)\\nThere is a force qE on q and a force – qE on – q. The net force on\\nthe dipole is zer o, since E is unifor m. However , the char ges ar e\\nseparated, so the forces act at different points, resulting in a torque\\non the dipole. When the net force is zero, the torque (couple) is\\nindependent of the origin. Its magnitude equals the magnitude of\\neach force multiplied by the arm of the couple (perpendicular\\ndistance between the two antiparallel forces).\\nMagnitude of torque = q E × 2 a sinq\\n       = 2 q a E  sinq\\nIts dir ection is nor mal to the plane of the paper , coming out of it.\\nThe magnitude of p × E is also p E sinq and its direction\\nis nor mal to the paper , coming out of it. Thus,\\nt tt tt  = p × E (1.22)\\nThis torque will tend to align the dipole with the field\\nE. When p is aligned with E, the torque is zero.\\nWhat happens if the field is not uniform? In that case,\\nthe net force will evidently be non-zero. In addition there\\nwill, in general, be a torque on the system as before. The\\ngeneral case is involved, so let us consider the simpler\\nsituations when p is parallel to E or antiparallel to E. In\\neither case, the net torque is zero, but there is a net force\\non the dipole if E is not uniform.\\nFigure 1.20 is self-explanatory. It is easily seen that\\nwhen p is parallel to E, the dipole has a net force in the\\ndirection of increasing field. When p is antiparallel to E,\\nthe net force on the dipole is in the direction of decreasing\\nfield. In general, the force depends on the orientation of p\\nwith respect to E.\\nThis brings us to a common observation in frictional\\nelectricity. A comb run through dry hair attracts pieces of\\npaper . The comb, as we know, acquir es char ge thr ough\\nfriction. But the paper is not charged. What then explains\\nthe attractive force?

For\\nmany purposes, however , it is impractical to work in ter ms of discr ete\\ncharges and we need to work with continuous charge distributions. For\\nexample, on the sur face of a char ged conductor , it is impractical to specify\\nthe charge distribution in terms of the locations of the microscopic charged\\nconstituents. It is more feasible to consider an area element DS (Fig. 1.21)\\non the surface of the conductor (which is very small on the macroscopic\\nscale but big enough to include a very large number of electrons) and\\nspecify the char ge DQ on that element. W e then define a surface char ge\\ndensity  s at the area element by\\nQ\\nSσΔ=Δ(1.23)\\nWe can do this at dif ferent points on the conductor and thus arrive at\\na continuous function s, called the surface charge density. The surface\\ncharge density s  so defined ignores the quantisation of charge and the\\ndiscontinuity in charge distribution at the microscopic level *. s  represents\\nmacroscopic surface charge density, which in a sense, is a smoothed out\\naverage of the microscopic charge density over an area element DS which,\\nas said before, is large microscopically but small macroscopically. The\\nunits for s are C/m2.\\nSimilar considerations apply for a line charge distribution and a volume\\ncharge distribution. The linear charge density  l of a wire is defined by\\nQ\\nlλΔ=Δ(1.24)\\nwhere Dl is a small line element of wire on the macroscopic scale that,\\nhowever , includes a lar ge number of micr oscopic char ged constituents,\\nand DQ is the charge contained in that line element. The units for l are\\nC/m. The volume charge density  (sometimes simply called charge density)\\nis defined in a similar manner:\\nQ\\nVρΔ=Δ(1.25)\\nwhere DQ is the charge included in the macroscopically small volume\\nelement DV that includes a large number of microscopic charged\\nconstituents. The units for r are C/m3.\\nThe notion of continuous charge distribution is similar to that we\\nadopt for continuous mass distribution in mechanics. When we refer toFIGURE  1.21\\nDefinition of linear ,\\nsurface and volume\\ncharge densities.\\nIn each case, the\\nelement ( Dl, DS, DV)\\nchosen is small on\\nthe macroscopic\\nscale but contains\\na very large number\\nof microscopic\\nconstituents.\\n*At the microscopic level, charge distribution is discontinuous, because they are\\ndiscrete charges separated by intervening space where there is no charge.\\n2024-25\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

W e can see that explicitly in\\nthe simple situation of Fig. 1.23.\\nHere the electric field is uniform and we are considering a closed\\ncylindrical surface, with its axis parallel to the uniform field E . The total\\nflux f  through the surface is  f = f1 + f2 + f3, where f1 and f2 represent\\nthe flux through the surfaces 1 and 2 (of circular cross-section) of the\\ncylinder and f3 is the flux through the curved cylindrical part of the\\nclosed surface. Now the normal to the surface 3 at every point is\\nperpendicular to E, so by definition of flux,  f3 = 0. Further , the outwar d\\nnormal to 2 is along E while the outward normal to 1 is opposite to E.\\nTherefore,\\nf1 = –E S1,     f2 = +E S2\\nS1 = S2 = S\\nwhere  S is the area of circular cross-section. Thus, the total flux is zero,\\nas expected by Gauss’s law. Thus, whenever you find that the net electric\\nflux through a closed surface is zero, we conclude that the total charge\\ncontained in the closed surface is zero.\\nThe great significance of Gauss’s law Eq. (1.31), is that it is true in\\ngeneral, and not only for the simple cases we have considered above. Let\\nus note some important points regarding this law:\\n(i)Gauss’s law is true for any closed surface, no matter what its shape\\nor size.\\n(ii)The term q on the right side of Gauss’s law, Eq. (1.31), includes the\\nsum of all charges enclosed by the surface. The charges may be located\\nanywhere inside the surface.\\n(iii)In the situation when the surface is so chosen that there are some\\ncharges inside and some outside, the electric field [whose flux appears\\non the left side of Eq. (1.31)] is due to all the charges, both inside and\\noutside S. The ter m q on the right side of Gauss’s law, however ,\\nrepresents only the total charge inside S.\\nFIGURE  1.23  Calculation of the\\nflux of uniform electric field\\nthrough the sur face of a cylinder .\\n2024-25\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

For some symmetric charge\\nconfigurations, however , it is possible to\\nobtain the electric field in a simple way using\\nthe Gauss’s law. This is best understood by\\nsome examples.\\n1.14.1 Field due to an infinitely\\nlong straight uniformly\\ncharged wire\\nConsider an infinitely long thin straight wire\\nwith uniform linear charge density l. The wire\\nis obviously an axis of symmetry. Suppose we\\ntake the radial vector from O to P and rotate it\\naround the wir e. The points P , P¢, P¢¢ so\\nobtained are completely equivalent with\\nrespect to the charged wire. This implies that\\nthe electric field must have the same magnitude\\nat these points. The direction of electric field at\\nevery point must be radial (outward if l > 0,\\ninward if l < 0). This is clear from Fig. 1.2 6.\\nConsider a pair of line elements P1 and P2\\nof the wire, as shown. The electric fields\\nproduced by the two elements of the pair when\\nsummed give a resultant electric field which\\nis radial (the components normal to the radial\\nvector cancel). This is true for any such pair\\nand hence the total field at any point P is\\nradial. Finally, since the wire is infinite,\\nelectric field does not depend on the position\\nof P along the length of the wire. In short, the\\nelectric field is everywhere radial in the plane\\ncutting the wire normally, and its magnitude\\ndepends only on the radial distance r.\\nTo calculate the field, imagine a cylindrical\\nGaussian surface, as shown in the Fig. 1.2 6(b).\\nSince the field is everywhere radial, flux\\nthrough the two ends of the cylindrical\\nGaussian surface is zero.

To calculate E at P, we take the\\nGaussian surface to be a sphere of radius r and with centre\\nO, passing thr ough P . All points on this spher e are equivalent\\nrelative to the given charged configuration. (That is what we\\nmean by spherical symmetry.) The electric field at each point\\nof the Gaussian surface, therefore, has the same magnitude\\nE and is along the radius vector at each point. Thus, E and\\nDS at every point are parallel and the flux through each\\nelement is E DS. Summing over all DS, the flux through the\\nGaussian surface is E × 4 p r2.

When an external force does work in taking a body from a\\npoint to another against a force like spring force or gravitational force,\\nthat work gets stored as potential energy of the body. When the external\\nforce is removed, the body moves, gaining kinetic energy and losing\\nan equal amount of potential energy. The sum of kinetic and\\npotential energies is thus conserved. Forces of this kind are called\\nconservative forces. Spring force and gravitational force are examples of\\nconservative forces.\\nCoulomb force between two (stationary) charges is also a conservative\\nforce. This is not surprising, since both have inverse-square dependence\\non distance and differ mainly in the proportionality constants – the\\nmasses in the gravitational law are replaced by charges in Coulomb’s\\nlaw. Thus, like the potential energy of a mass in a gravitational\\nfield, we can define electrostatic potential energy of a charge in an\\nelectrostatic field.\\nConsider an electrostatic field  E E E  E E due to some charge configuration.\\nFirst, for simplicity, consider the field E EE EE due to a charge Q placed at the\\norigin.

For definiteness, let us take Q, q > 0.\\nTwo remarks may be made here. First, we assume\\nthat the test charge q is so small that it does not disturb\\nthe original configuration, namely the charge Q at the\\norigin (or else, we keep Q fixed at the origin by some\\nunspecified force). Second, in bringing the charge q from\\nR to P , we apply an exter nal for ce Fext just enough to\\ncounter the repulsive electric force FE (i.e, Fext= –FE).\\nThis means there is no net force on or acceleration of\\nthe char ge q when it is br ought fr om R to P , i.e., it is\\nbrought with infinitesimally slow constant speed. In\\nthis situation, work done by the external force is the negative of the work\\ndone by the electric force, and gets fully stored in the form of potential\\nenergy of the char ge q. If the exter nal for ce is r emoved on r eaching P, the\\nelectric force will take the charge away from Q – the stored energy (potential\\nenergy) at P is used to provide kinetic energy to the charge q in such a\\nway that the sum of the kinetic and potential energies is conserved.\\nThus, work done by external forces in moving a charge q from R to P is\\nWRP =   \\n        =    –  (2.1)\\nThis work done is against electrostatic repulsive force and gets stored\\nas potential energy.\\nAt every point in electric field, a particle with charge q possesses a\\ncertain electrostatic potential energy, this work done increases its potential\\nenergy by an amount equal to potential energy difference between points\\nR and P .\\nThus, potential energy difference\\nP R RP U U U WΔ = − = (2.2)\\n(Note here that this displacement is in an opposite sense to the electric\\nforce and hence work done by electric field is negative, i.e. , –WRP.)\\nTherefore, we can define electric potential energy difference between\\ntwo points as the work required to be done by an external force in moving\\n(without acceleratin g) charge q from one point to another for electric field\\nof any arbitrary charge configuration.\\nTwo important comments may be made at this stage:\\n(i)The right side of Eq. (2.2) depends only on the initial and final positions\\nof the charge. It means that the work done by an electrostatic field in\\nmoving a charge from one point to another depends only on the initial\\nand the final points and is independent of the path taken to go from\\none point to the other . This is the fundamental characteristic of a\\nconservative force. The concept of the potential energy would not be\\nmeaningful if the work depended on the path.

This is true in general: for any charge\\nconfiguration , equipotential sur face thr ough a point is nor mal to the\\nelectric field at that point . The proof of this statement is simple.\\nIf the field were not normal to the equipotential surface, it would\\nhave non-zero component along the surface. To move a unit test charge\\nagainst the direction of the component of the field, work would have to\\nbe done. But this is in contradiction to the definition of an equipotential\\nsurface: there is no potential difference between any two points on the\\nsurface and no work is required to move a test charge on the surface.\\nThe electric field must, therefore, be normal to the equipotential surface\\nat every point.

In this section, we ask a related but a distinct question.\\nWhat is the potential energy of a charge q in a given field? This question\\nwas, in fact, the starting point that led us to the notion of the electrostatic\\npotential (Sections 2.1 and 2.2). But here we address this question again\\nto clarify in what way it is different from the discussion in Section 2.7.\\nThe main difference is that we are now concerned with the potential\\nenergy of a char ge (or char ges) in an exter nal field. The exter nal field E is\\nnot produced by the given charge(s) whose potential energy we wish to\\ncalculate.  E is produced by sources external to the given charge(s).The\\nexternal sources may be known, but often they are unknown or\\nunspecified; what is specified is the electric field E or the electrostatic\\npotential V due to the exter nal sour ces. W e assume that the char ge q\\ndoes not significantly affect the sources producing the external field. This\\nis true if q is very small, or the external sources are held fixed by other\\nunspecified forces. Even if q is finite, its influence on the external sources\\nmay still be ignored in the situation when very strong sources far away\\nat infinity produce a finite field E in the region of interest. Note again that\\nwe are interested in determining the potential energy of a given charge q\\n(and later , a system of char ges) in the exter nal field; we ar e not inter ested\\nin the potential energy of the sources producing the external electric field.\\nThe external electric field E\\n and the corresponding external potential\\nV may vary from point to point. By definition, V at a point P is the work\\ndone in bringing a unit positive char ge from infinity to the point P .\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

This fact can be taken as the defining pr operty of a\\nconductor . A conductor has fr ee electr ons. As long as electric field is not\\nzero, the free charge carriers would experience force and drift. In the\\nstatic situation, the free charges have so distributed themselves that the\\nelectric field is zero everywhere inside. Electrostatic field is zero inside a\\nconductor .\\n2.At the sur face of a char ged conductor , electr ostatic field\\nmust be normal to the surface at every point\\nIf E were not normal to the surface, it would have some non-zero\\ncomponent along the surface. Free charges on the surface of the conductor\\nwould then experience force and move. In the static situation, therefore,\\nE should have no tangential component. Thus electrostatic field  at the\\nsurface of a char ged conductor must be nor mal to the sur face at every\\npoint. (For a conductor without any surface charge density, field is zero\\neven at the surface.) See result 5.\\n3.The interior of a conductor can have no excess charge in\\nthe static situation\\nA neutral conductor has equal amounts of positive and negative charges\\nin every small volume or surface element. When the conductor is charged,\\nthe excess charge can reside only on the surface in the static situation.\\nThis follows from the Gauss’s law. Consider any arbitrary volume element\\nv inside a conductor . On the closed sur face S bounding the volume\\nelement v, electrostatic field is zero. Thus the total electric flux through S\\nis zero. Hence, by Gauss’s law, there is no net charge enclosed by S. But\\nthe surface S can be made as small as you like, i.e., the volume v can be\\nmade vanishingly small. This means there is no net charge at any point\\ninside the conductor , and any excess char ge must r eside at the sur face.\\n4.Electrostatic potential is constant throughout the volume\\nof the conductor and has the same value (as inside) on\\nits surface\\nThis follows from results 1 and 2 above. Since E = 0 inside the conductor\\nand has no tangential component on the surface, no work is done in\\nmoving a small test charge within the conductor and on its surface.

In contrast to conductors,\\nthey have no (or negligible number o f) charge carriers. Recall from Section\\n2.9 what happens when a conductor is placed in an\\nexternal electric field. The free charge carriers move\\nand charge distribution in the conductor adjusts\\nitself in such a way that the electric field due to\\ninduced charges opposes the external field within\\nthe conductor. This happens until, in the static\\nsituation, the two fields cancel each other and the\\nnet electrostatic field in the conductor is zero. In a\\ndielectric, this free movement of charges is not\\npossible. It turns out that the external field induces\\ndipole moment by stretching or re-orienting\\nmolecules of the dielectric. The collective effect of all\\nthe molecular dipole moments is net charges  on the\\nsurface of the dielectric which produce a field that\\nopposes the external field.  Unlike in a conductor,\\nhowever, the opposing field so induced does not\\nexactly cancel the external field. It only reduces it.\\nThe extent of the effect depends on the\\nnature of the dielectric. To understand the\\neffect, we need to look at the charge\\ndistribution of a dielectric at the\\nmolecular level.\\nThe molecules of a substance may be\\npolar or non-polar. In a non-polar\\nmolecule, the centres of positive and\\nnegative charges coincide. The molecule\\nthen has no permanent (or intrinsic) dipole\\nmoment. Examples of non-polar molecules\\nare oxygen (O2) and hydrogen (H2)\\nmolecules which, because of their\\nsymmetry, have no dipole moment. On the\\nother hand, a polar molecule is one in which\\nthe centres of positive and negative charges\\nare separated (even when there is no\\nexternal field). Such molecules have a\\npermanent dipole moment. An ionic\\nmolecule such as HCl or a molecule of water\\n(H2O) are examples of polar molecules.FIGURE  2.20  Difference in behaviour\\nof a conductor and a dielectric\\nin an external electric field.\\nFIGURE  2.21  Some examples of polar\\nand non-polar molecules.\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

The displacement stops when\\nthe external force on the constituent\\ncharges of the molecule is balanced by\\nthe restoring force (due to internal fields\\nin the molecule). The non-polar molecule\\nthus develops an induced dipole moment.\\nThe dielectric is said to be polarised by\\nthe exter nal field. W e consider only the\\nsimple situation when the induced dipole\\nmoment is in the direction of the field and\\nis proportional to the field strength.\\n(Substances for which th is assumption\\nis true are called linear isotropic\\ndielectrics. ) The induced dipole moments\\nof different molecules add up giving a net\\ndipole moment of the dielectric in the\\npresence of the external field.\\nA dielectric with polar molecules also\\ndevelops a net dipole moment in an\\nexternal field, but for a different reason.\\nIn the absence of any external field, the\\ndifferent permanent dipoles are oriented\\nrandomly due to thermal agitation; so\\nthe total dipole moment is zero. When\\nan external field is applied, the individual dipole moments tend  to align\\nwith the field. When summed overall the molecules, there is then a net\\ndipole moment in the direction of the external field, i.e., the dielectric is\\npolarised. The extent of polarisation depends on the relative strength of\\ntwo mutually opposite factors: the dipole potential energy in the external\\nfield tending to align the dipoles with the field and thermal energy tending\\nto disrupt the alignment. There may be, in addition, the  ‘induced dipole\\nmoment’ effect as for non-polar molecules, but generally the alignment\\neffect is more important for polar molecules.\\nThus in either case, whether polar or non-polar , a dielectric develops\\na net dipole moment in the presence of an external field.

The conductors have charges, say Q1 and Q2, and potentials\\nV1 and V2. Usually, in practice, the two conductors have charges Q\\nand – Q, with potential difference V = V1 – V2 between them. We shall\\nconsider only this kind of charge configuration of the capacitor. (Even a\\nsingle conductor can be used as a capacitor by assuming the other at\\ninfinity.) The conductors may be so charged by connecting them to the\\ntwo terminals of a battery. Q is called the charge of the capacitor, though\\nthis, in fact, is the charge on one of the conductors – the total charge  of\\nthe capacitor  is zero.\\nThe electric field in the region between the\\nconductors is proportional to the charge Q. That\\nis, if the charge on the capacitor is, say  doubled,\\nthe electric field will also be doubled at every point.\\n(This follows from the direct proportionality\\nbetween field and charge implied by Coulomb’s\\nlaw and the superposition principle.) Now,\\npotential difference V is the work done per unit\\npositive charge in taking a small test charge from\\nthe conductor 2 to 1 against the field.\\nConsequently, V is also proportio nal to Q, and the\\nratio Q/V is a constant:\\nQCV= (2.38)\\nThe constant C is called the capacitance  of the capacitor. C is independent\\nof Q or V, as stated above. The capacitance C depends only on theFIGURE  2.23  A uniformly\\npolarised dielectric amounts\\nto induced surface charge\\ndensity, but no volume\\ncharge density.\\nFIGURE  2.24 A system of two conductors\\nseparated by an insulator for ms a capacitor .\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

[As we shall see later, it also depends on the nature of the\\ninsulator (dielectric) separating the two conductors.]  The SI unit of\\ncapacitance is 1 farad (=1 coulomb volt-1) or 1 F = 1 C V–1. A capacitor\\nwith fixed capacitance is symbolically shown as - --||---, while the one with\\nvariable capacitance is shown as  .\\nEquation (2.38) shows that for large C, V is small for a given Q. This\\nmeans a capacitor with large capacitance can hold large amount of charge\\nQ at a r elatively small V. This is of practical importance. High potential\\ndifference implies strong electric field around the conductors. A strong\\nelectric field can ionise the surrounding air and accelerate the charges so\\nproduced to the oppositely charged plates, thereby neutralising the charge\\non the capacitor plates, at least partly. In other words, the charge of the\\ncapacitor leaks away due to the reduction in insulating power of the\\nintervening medium.\\nThe maximum electric field that a dielectric medium can withstand\\nwithout break-down (of its insulating property) is called its dielectric\\nstrength ; for air it is about 3 × 106 Vm–1. For a separation between\\nconductors of the order of 1 cm or so, this field corresponds to a potential\\ndifference of 3 × 104 V between the conductors. Thus, for a capacitor to\\nstore a large amount of charge without  leaking, its capacitance should\\nbe high enough so that the potential difference and hence the electric\\nfield do not exceed the break-down limits. Put differently, there is a limit\\nto the amount of charge that can be stored on a given capacitor without\\nsignificant leaking. In practice, a farad is a very big unit; the most common\\nunits are its sub-multiples 1 mF = 10–6 F, 1 nF = 10–9 F, 1 pF = 10–12 F,\\netc. Besides its use in storing charge, a capacitor is a key element of most\\nac circuits with important functions, as described in Chapter 7.\\n2.12  T HE PARALLEL  PLATE CAPACITOR\\nA parallel plate capacitor consists of two large plane parallel conducting\\nplates separated by a small distance (Fig. 2.25). We first take the\\nintervening medium between the plates to be\\nvacuum. The effect of a dielectric medium between\\nthe plates is discussed in the next section. Let A be\\nthe area of each plate and d the separation between\\nthem. The two plates have charges Q and – Q. Since\\nd is much smaller than the linear dimension of the\\nplates ( d2 << A), we can use the result on electric\\nfield by an infinite plane sheet of uniform surface\\ncharge density (Section 1.15). Plate 1 has surface\\ncharge density s = Q/A and plate 2 has a surface\\ncharge density – s. Using Eq.

It then\\nfollows that the right plate of C1 has charge – Q\\nand the left plate of C2  has charge Q. If this was\\nnot so, the net charge on each capacitor would\\nnot be zero. This would result in an electric field\\nin the conductor connecting C1and C2. Charge\\nwould flow until the net charge on both C1 and\\nC2 is zero and there is no electric field in the\\nconductor connecting C1 and C2.

If it is\\nfree to move, it will thus move contributing to a current. In nature, free\\ncharged particles do exist like in upper strata of atmosphere called the\\nionospher e. However , in atoms and molecules, the negatively char ged\\nelectrons and the positively charged nuclei are bound to each other and\\nare thus not free to move. Bulk matter is made up of many molecules, a\\ngram of water , for example, contains appr oximately 1022 molecules. These\\nmolecules are so closely packed that the electrons are no longer attached\\nto individual nuclei. In some materials, the electrons will still be bound,\\ni.e., they will not accelerate even if an electric field is applied. In other\\nmaterials, notably metals, some of the electrons are practically free to move\\nwithin the bulk material. These materials, generally called conductors,\\ndevelop electric currents in them when an electric field is applied.\\nIf we consider solid conductors, then of course the atoms are tightly\\nbound to each other so that the current is carried by the negatively\\ncharged electr ons. Ther e are, however , other types of conductors like\\nelectrolytic solutions where positive and negative charges both can move.\\nIn our discussions, we will focus only on solid conductors so that the\\ncurrent is carried by the negatively charged electrons in the background\\nof fixed positive ions.\\nConsider first the case when no electric field is present.

In the next sections, we shall study the steady\\ncurrent that results from a steady electric field in conductors.\\n3.4  O HM’S LAW\\nA basic law regarding flow of currents was discovered by G.S. Ohm in\\n1828, long before the physical mechanism responsible for flow of currents\\nwas discovered. Imagine a conductor through which a current I is flowing\\nand let V be the potential dif ference between the ends of the conductor .\\nThen Ohm’s law states that\\n     V µ I\\nor, V = R I (3.3)\\nwhere the constant of proportionality R is called the resistance  of the\\nconductor . The SI units of r esistance is ohm, and is denoted by the symbol\\nW. The r esistance R not only depends on the material of the conductor\\nbut also on the dimensions of the conductor . The dependence of R on the\\ndimensions of the conductor can easily be determined as follows.\\nConsider a conductor satisfying Eq. (3.3) to be in the form of a slab of\\nlength l and cross sectional area A [Fig. 3.2(a)]. Imagine placing two such\\nidentical slabs side by side [Fig. 3.2(b)], so that the length of the\\ncombination is 2 l. The current flowing through the  combination is the\\nsame as that flowing through either of the slabs. If V is the potential\\ndifference across the ends of the first slab, then V is also the potential\\ndifference across the ends of the second slab since the second slab isFIGURE  3.1 Charges + Q and – Q put at the ends\\nof a metallic cylinder .

If we consider all the electrons, their average velocity will be\\nzero since their directions are random. Thus, if there are N electrons and\\nthe velocity of the ith electron ( i = 1, 2, 3, ... N ) at a given time is vi, then\\n10\\n1Ni\\niv=\\n=∑N\\n(3.14)\\nConsider now the situation when an electric field is\\npresent. Electrons will be accelerated due to this\\nfield by\\n=– Eae\\nm(3.15)\\nwhere – e is the charge and  m is the mass of an electron.\\nConsider again the ith electron at a given time t. This\\nelectron would have had its last collision some time\\nbefore t, and let ti be the time elapsed after its last\\ncollision. If vi was its velocity immediately after the last\\ncollision, then its velocity Vi at time t is\\n−  = +     EV vi i ietm(3.16)\\nsince starting with its last collision it was accelerated\\n(Fig. 3.3) with an acceleration given by Eq. (3.15) for a\\ntime interval ti. The average velocity of the electrons at\\ntime t is the average of all the Vi’s. The average of vi’s is\\nzero [Eq. (3.14)] since immediately after any collision,\\nthe direction of the velocity of an electron is completely\\nrandom. The collisions of the electrons do not occur at\\nregular intervals but at random times. Let us denote by\\nt, the average time between successive collisions. Then\\nat a given time, some of the electrons would have spentFIGURE  3.3 A schematic picture of\\nan electron moving from a point A to\\nanother point B through repeated\\ncollisions, and straight line travel\\nbetween collisions (full lines).

In other words, the time ti in\\nEq. (3.16) will be less than t for some and more than t for others as we go\\nthrough the values of i = 1, 2 ..... N. The average value of ti then is t\\n(known as relaxation time ). Thus, averaging Eq.

It tells us that the\\nelectrons move with an average velocity which is\\nindependent of time, although electrons are\\naccelerated. This is the phenomenon of drift and the\\nvelocity vd in Eq.

Consider\\na planar area A, located inside the conductor such that\\nthe normal to the area is parallel to E (Fig. 3.4). Then\\nbecause of the drift, in an infinitesimal amount of time\\nDt, all electrons to the left of the area at distances upto\\n|vd|Dt would have crossed the area. If n is the number\\nof free electrons per unit volume in the metal, then\\nthere are n Dt |vd|A such electrons. Since each\\nelectron carries a charge – e, the total charge transported across this area\\nA to the right in time Dt is –ne A|vd|Dt. E is directed towards the left and\\nhence the total charge transported along E across the area is negative of\\nthis. The amount of charge crossing the area A in time Dt is by definition\\n[Eq.

Electrical power is transmitted\\nfrom power stations to homes and factories, which\\nmay be hundreds of miles away, via transmission\\ncables. One obviously wants to minimise the power\\nloss in the transmission cables connecting the power stations to homes\\nand factories. W e shall  see now how this can be achieved. Consider a\\ndevice R, to which a power P is to be delivered via transmission cables\\nhaving a resistance Rc to be dissipated by it finally. If V is the voltage\\nacross R and I the current through it, then\\nP = V I (3.34)\\nThe connecting wires from the power station to the device has a finite\\nresistance Rc. The power dissipated in the connecting wires, which is\\nwasted is Pc  with\\nPc = I2 Rc\\n   2\\n2cP R\\nV= (3.35)\\nfrom Eq. (3.32). Thus, to drive a device of power P, the power wasted in the\\nconnecting wires is inversely proportional to V 2. The  transmission cables\\nfrom power stations are hundreds of miles long and their resistance Rc is\\nconsiderable. To reduce Pc, these wires carry current at enormous values\\nof V and this is the reason for the high voltage danger signs on transmission\\nlines — a common sight as we move away from populated areas. Using\\nelectricity at such voltages is not safe and hence at the other end, a device\\ncalled a transformer lowers the voltage to a value suitable for use.\\n3.10 C ELLS, EMF, INTERNAL  RESIST ANCE\\nWe have alr eady mentioned that a simple device to maintain a steady\\ncurrent in an electric circuit is the electrolytic cell. Basically a cell has\\ntwo electrodes, called the positive (P) and the negative (N), as shown inFIGURE  3.11  Heat is produced in the\\nresistor R which is connected across\\nthe terminals of a cell. The energy\\ndissipated in the resistor R comes from\\nthe chemical energy of the electrolyte.\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

They are immersed in an electrolytic solution. Dipped in\\nthe solution, the electrodes exchange charges with the electrolyte.\\nThe positive electrode has a potential difference V+ (V+ > 0) between\\nitself and the electrolyte solution immediately adjacent to it marked\\nA in the figure. Similarly, the negative electrode develops a negative\\npotential  – ( V– ) (V– ≥ 0) relative to the electrolyte adjacent to it,\\nmarked as B in the figure. When there is no current, the electrolyte\\nhas the same potential throughout, so that the potential difference\\nbetween P and N is V+ – (–V–) = V+ + V– . This difference is called the\\nelectromotive force  (emf) of the cell and is denoted by e. Thus\\ne = V++V– >  0 (3.36)\\nNote that e is, actually, a potential difference and not a force . The\\nname emf, however , is used because of historical r easons, and was\\ngiven at a time when the phenomenon was not understood properly.\\nTo understand the significance of e, consider a resistor R\\nconnected across the cell (Fig. 3.12). A current I flows across R\\nfrom C to D. As explained before, a steady current is maintained\\nbecause current flows from N to P through the electrolyte. Clearly,\\nacross the electrolyte the same current flows through the electrolyte\\nbut fr om N to P , wher eas thr ough R, it flows fr om P to N.\\nThe electrolyte through which a current flows has a finite\\nresistance r, called the inter nal r esistance . Consider first the\\nsituation when R is infinite so that I = V/R = 0, where V is the\\npotential difference between P and N. Now,\\nV = Potential difference between P and A\\n       + Potential difference between A and B\\n       + Potential  difference between B and N\\n   = e (3.37)\\nThus, emf e is the potential difference between the positive and\\nnegative electrodes in an open circuit, i.e., when no current is\\nflowing through the cell.\\nIf however R is finite, I is not zero. In that case the potential difference\\nbetween P and N is\\nV = V++ V– – I r\\n   = e – I r (3.38)\\nNote the negative sign in the expression ( I r) for the potential difference\\nbetween A and B. This is because the current I flows from B to A in the\\nelectrolyte.\\nIn  practical calculations, internal resistances of cells in the circuit\\nmay be neglected when the  curr ent I is such that e >> I r. The actual\\nvalues of the internal resistances of cells vary from cell to cell. The internal\\nresistance of dry cells, however , is much higher than the common\\nelectrolytic cells.\\nWe also observe that since V is the potential dif ference acr oss R, we\\nhave from Ohm’s law\\nV = I  R (3.39)\\nCombining Eqs.

Two rules, called Kirchhoff’s rules ,\\nare very useful for analysis of electric circuits.\\nGiven a circuit, we start by labelling currents in each resistor by a\\nsymbol, say I, and a directed arrow to indicate that a current I flows\\nalong the resistor in the direction indicated. If ultimately I is determined\\nto be positive, the actual current in the resistor is in the direction of the\\narrow. If I turns out to be negative, the current actually flows in a direction\\nopposite to the arrow. Similarly, for each source (i.e., cell or some other\\nsource of electrical power) the positive and negative electrodes are labelled,\\nas well as, a directed arrow with a symbol for the current flowing through\\nthe cell. This will tell us the potential difference, V = V (P) – V (N) = e – I r\\n[Eq. (3.38) between the positive terminal P and the negative terminal N; I\\nhere is the current flowing from N to P through the cell]. If, while labelling\\nthe current I through the cell one goes from P to N, then of course\\nV = e + I r (3.60)\\nHaving clarified labelling, we now state the rules and the proof:\\n(a) Junction rule:  At any junction, the sum of the currents entering\\nthe junction is equal to the sum of currents leaving the junction\\n(Fig. 3.15).Gustav Robert  Kirchhoff\\n(1824 – 1887)  German\\nphysicist, professor at\\nHeidelberg and at\\nBerlin.

However , it was only about 200 years ago, in 1820, that it was\\nrealised that they were intimately related. During a lecture demonstration\\nin the summer of 1820, Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted noticed\\nthat a current in a straight wire caused a noticeable deflection in a nearby\\nmagnetic compass needle. He investigated this phenomenon. He found\\nthat the alignment of the needle is tangential to an imaginary circle which\\nhas the straight wire as its centre and has its plane perpendicular to the\\nwire. This situation is depicted in Fig.4.1(a). It is noticeable when the\\ncurrent is large and the needle sufficiently close to the wire so that the\\nearth’s magnetic field may be ignored. Reversing the direction of the\\ncurrent reverses the orientation of the needle [Fig. 4.1(b)]. The deflection\\nincreases on increasing the current or bringing the needle closer to the\\nwire. Iron filings sprinkled around the wire arrange themselves in\\nconcentric circles with the wire as the centre [Fig. 4.1(c)]. Oersted\\nconcluded that moving charges or currents produced a magnetic field\\nin the surrounding space .\\nFollowing this, there was intense experimentation.

We have learnt  in Mechanics (see Class XI book, Chapter\\n5) that a force on a particle does work if  the force has a component along\\n(or opposed to) the direction of motion of the particle. In the case of motion\\nof a charge in a magnetic field, the magnetic force is perpendicular to the\\nvelocity of the particle. So no work is done and no change in the magnitude\\nof the velocity is produced (though the direction of momentum may be\\nchanged). [Notice that this is unlike the force due to an electric field, qE,\\nwhich can have a component parallel (or antiparallel) to motion and thus\\ncan transfer energy in addition to momentum.]\\nWe shall consider motion of a charged particle in a unifor m magnetic\\nfield. First consider the case of v perpendicular to  B.  The\\nperpendicular force, q v × B , acts as a centripetal force and\\nproduces a circular motion perpendicular to the magnetic field.\\nThe particle will describe a circle if v and B are  perpendicular\\nto each other (Fig. 4.5).\\nIf velocity has a component along B , this component\\nremains unchanged as the motion along the magnetic field will\\nnot be affected by the magnetic field. The motion in a plane\\nperpendicular to B is as before a circular one, thereby producing\\na helical motion  (Fig. 4.6).\\nYou have already learnt in earlier classes (See Class XI,\\nChapter 3) that if r is the radius of the circular path of a particle,\\nthen a force of  m v2 / r, acts perpendicular to the path towards\\nthe centre of the circle, and is called the  centripetal force. If the\\nvelocity v is perpendicular to the magnetic field   B, the  magnetic\\nforce is  perpendicular to both  v and B and acts\\nlike a centripetal force. It has a magnitude q v\\nB. Equating the two expressions for centripetal\\nforce,\\nm v 2/r = q v B, which gives\\nr =  m v / qB (4.5)\\nfor the radius of the circle described by the\\ncharged particle. The larger the  momentum,  the\\nlarger is the radius and bigger the circle\\ndescribed. If ω is the angular frequency, then   v\\n= ω  r. So,\\nω  = 2π ν =  q B/ m [4.6(a)]\\nwhich is independent of the velocity or energy .\\nHere ν is the frequency of rotation.

We take the angle between the field and the normal to\\nthe coil to be angle θ (The previous case corresponds to\\nθ = π/2). Figure 4.19 illustrates this general case.\\nThe forces on the arms BC and DA are equal, opposite, and act along\\nthe axis of the coil, which connects the centres of mass of BC and DA.\\nBeing collinear along the axis they cancel each other, resulting in no net\\nforce or torque. The forces on arms AB and CD are F1 and F2. They too\\nare equal and opposite, with magnitude,\\nF1 = F2 = I b B\\nBut they are not collinear!  This results in a couple as before. The\\ntorque is, however, less than the earlier case when plane of loop was\\nalong the magnetic field. This is because the perpendicular distance\\nbetween the forces of the couple has decreased.

Note, however,\\na fundamental difference: an electric dipole is built up of two elementary\\nunits — the charges (or electric monopoles). In magnetism, a magnetic\\ndipole (or a current loop) is the most elementary element. The equivalent\\nof electric charges, i.e., magnetic monopoles, are not known to exist.\\nWe have shown that a current loop (i) produces a magnetic field (see\\nFig. 4 .10) and behaves like a magnetic dipole at large distances, and\\n(ii) is subject to torque like a magnetic needle. This led Ampere to suggest\\nthat all magnetism is due to circulating currents. This seems to be partly\\ntrue and no magnetic monopoles have been seen so far. However,\\nelementary particles such as an electron or a proton also carry an intrinsic\\nmagnetic moment, not accounted by circulating currents.\\n4.10  THE  MOVING C OIL G\\nALVANOMETER\\nCurre nts and voltages in circuits have been discussed extensively in\\nChapters 3.

It is a device whose principle can be understood\\non the basis of our discussion in Section 4.9.\\nThe galvanometer consists of a coil, with many turns, free to rotate\\nabout a fixed axis (Fig. 4.20), in a uniform radial magnetic field. There is\\na cylindrical soft iron core which not only makes the field radial but also\\nincreases the strength of the magnetic field.  When a current flows through\\nthe coil, a torque acts on it.

(ii) For measuring currents,\\nthe galvanometer has to be connected in series, and as it has a large\\nresistance, this will change the value of the current in the circuit. To\\novercome these difficulties, one attaches a small resistance rs, called shunt\\nresistance , in parallel with the galvanometer coil; so that most of the\\ncurrent passes through the shunt. The resistance of this arrangement is,\\nRG rs / (RG  + rs)   ≃  rs         if    RG >>  rs\\nIf rs has small value, in relation to the resistance of the rest of the\\ncircuit Rc, the effect of introducing the measuring instrument is also small\\nand negligible.

The word magnet is derived from\\nthe name of an island in Greece called magnesia  where magnetic ore\\ndeposits were found, as early as 600 BC.\\nIn the previous chapter we have learned that moving charges or electric\\ncurrents produce magnetic fields. This discovery, which was made in the\\nearly part of the nineteenth century is credited to Oersted, Ampere, Biot\\nand Savart, among others.\\nIn the pr esent chapter , we take a look at magnetism as a subject in its\\nown right.\\nSome of the commonly known ideas regarding magnetism are:\\n(i)The earth behaves as a magnet with the magnetic field pointing\\napproximately from the geographic south to the north.\\n(ii)When a bar magnet is freely suspended, it points in  the north-south\\ndirection.

Cutting a bar magnet in\\nhalf is like cutting a solenoid. We get two smaller solenoids with weaker\\nmagnetic properties. The field lines remain continuous, emerging from\\none face of the solenoid and entering into the other face. One can test this\\nanalogy by moving a small compass needle in the neighbourhood of a\\nbar magnet and a current-carrying finite solenoid and noting that the\\ndeflections of the needle are similar in both cases.\\nTo make this analogy more firm we may calculate the axial field of a\\nfinite solenoid depicted in Fig. 5.3 (a). We can demonstrate that at large\\ndistances this axial field resembles that of a bar magnet.\\nThe magnitude of the field at point P due to the solenoid is\\n0\\n32\\n4mBrµ\\nπ= (5.1)\\nThis is also the far axial magnetic field of a bar magnet which one may\\nobtain experimentally. Thus, a bar magnet and a solenoid produce similar\\nmagnetic fields. The magnetic moment of a bar magnet is thus equal to\\nthe magnetic moment of an equivalent solenoid that produces the same\\nmagnetic field.\\n5.2.3  The dipole in a uniform magnetic field\\nLet’s place a small compass needle of known magnetic moment m allowing\\nit to oscillate in the magnetic field. This arrangement is shown in\\nFig. 5.3(b).\\nThe torque on the needle is [see Eq.

Taking the constant of integration to be\\nzero means fixing the zero of potential energy at θ = 90°, i.e., when the\\nneedle is perpendicular to the field. Equation (5.3) shows that potential\\nenergy is minimum (= – mB) at θ = 0° (most stable position) and maximum\\n(= +mB) at θ = 180° (most unstable position).\\nExample 5.1\\n(a)What happens if a bar magnet is cut into two pieces: (i) transverse\\nto its length, (ii) along its length?\\n(b)A magnetised needle in a uniform magnetic field experiences a\\ntorque but no net force.

The iron nail experiences a non-\\nuniform field due to the bar magnet. There is induced magnetic\\nmoment in the nail, therefore, it experiences both force and\\ntorque. The net force is attractive because the induced south\\npole (say) in the nail is closer to the north pole of magnet than\\ninduced north pole.\\n(c)Not necessarily.

His mathematical\\ntheory of curved surface\\nlaid the foundation for the\\nlater work of Riemann.\\nFor instance for the configuration Q3 for which Q is along the\\nperpendicular bisector of the dipole P, the magnetic moment of Q is\\nparallel to the magnetic field at the position 3.

This is consistent with the\\nfact that no net charge is enclosed by the surface. However,\\nin the same figure, for the closed surfac e ii , there  is a net\\noutward flux, since it does include a net (positive) charge.\\nThe situation is radically different for magnetic fields\\nwhich are continuous and form closed loops. Examine the\\nGaussian surfaces represented by  i  or  ii  in Fig 5. 2(a) or\\nFig. 5.2(b). Both cases visually demonstrate that the\\nnumber of magnetic field lines leaving the surface is\\nbalanced by the number of lines entering it. The net\\nmagnetic flux is zero for both the surfaces . This is true\\nfor any closed surface.\\nFIGURE  5.5\\nConsider a small vector area element ∆S of a closed surface S as in\\nFig. 5.5.

Magnetic field lines can never emanate from a point, as\\nshown in figure. Over any closed surface, the net flux of B must\\nalways be zero, i.e., pictorially as many field lines should seem to\\nenter the surface as the number of lines leaving it. The field lines\\nshown, in fact, represent electric field of a long positively charged\\nwire.

Magnetic field lines (like electric field lines) can never cross\\neach other, because otherwise the direction of field at the point of\\nintersection is ambiguous. There is further error in the figure.\\nMagnetostatic field lines can never form closed loops around empty\\nspace. A closed loop of static magnetic field line must enclose a\\nregion across which a current is passing. By contrast, electrostatic\\nfield lines can never form closed loops, neither in empty space,\\nnor when the loop encloses charges.\\n(c)Right . Magnetic lines are completely confined within a toroid.\\nNothing wrong here in field lines forming closed loops, since each\\nloop encloses a region across which a current passes. Note, for\\nclarity of figure, only a few field lines within the toroid have been\\nshown. Actually, the entire region enclosed by the windings\\ncontains magnetic field.\\n(d)Wrong. Field lines due to a solenoid at its ends and outside cannot\\nbe so completely straight and confined; such a thing violates\\nAmpere’s law. The lines should curve out at both ends, and meet\\neventually to form closed loops.\\n(e)Right . These are field lines outside and inside a bar magnet. Note\\ncarefully the direction of field lines inside. Not all field lines emanate\\nout of a north pole (or converge into a south pole). Around both\\nthe N-pole, and the S-pole, the net flux of the field is zero.\\n(f)Wrong. These field lines cannot possibly represent a magnetic field.\\nLook at the upper region. All the field lines seem to emanate out of\\nthe shaded plate. The net flux through a surface surrounding the\\nshaded plate is not zero.

The difference between Fig. [5.6(e) and ( f)]  should be\\ncarefully grasped.\\n(g)Wrong . Magnetic field lines between two pole pieces cannot be\\nprecisely straight at the ends.

These\\nare metals, cooled to very low temperatures which exhibits both perfect\\nconductivity  and perfect diamagnetism . Here the field lines are completely\\nexpelled!  χ = –1 and µr = 0. A superconductor repels a magnet and (by\\nNewton’s third law) is repelled by the magnet. The phenomenon of perfect\\ndiamagnetism in superconductors is called the Meissner effect , after the\\nname of its discoverer. Superconducting magnets can be gainfully\\nexploited in variety of situations, for example, for running magnetically\\nlevitated superfast trains.\\n5.5.2  Paramagnetism\\nParamagnetic substances are those which get weakly magnetised when\\nplaced in an external magnetic field. They have tendency to move from a\\nregion of weak magnetic field to strong magnetic field, i.e., they get weakly\\nattracted to a magnet.\\nThe individual atoms (or ions or molecules) of a paramagnetic material\\npossess a permanent magnetic dipole moment of their own. On account\\nof the ceaseless random thermal motion of the atoms, no net magnetisation\\nis seen. In the presence of an external field B0, which is strong enough,\\nand at low temperatures, the individual atomic dipole moment can be\\nmade to align and point in the same direction as B0. Figure 5.7(b) shows\\na bar of paramagnetic material placed in an external field. The field lines\\ngets concentrated inside the material, and the field inside is enhanced. In\\nmost cases, this enhancement is slight, being one part in 105. When placed\\nin a non-uniform magnetic field, the bar will tend to move from weak field\\nto strong.\\nSome paramagnetic materials are aluminium, sodium, calcium,\\noxygen (at STP) and copper chloride. For a paramagnetic material both χ\\nand µr depend not only on the material, but also (in a simple fashion) on\\nthe sample temperature. As the field is increased or the temperature is\\nlowered, the magnetisation increases until it reaches the saturation value\\nat which point all the dipoles are perfectly aligned with the field.\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

They have strong tendency to move\\nfrom a region of weak magnetic field to strong magnetic field, i.e., they get\\nstrongly attracted to a magnet.\\nThe individual atoms (or ions or molecules) in a ferromagnetic material\\npossess a dipole moment as in a paramagnetic material. However, they\\ninteract with one another in such a way that they spontaneously align\\nthemselves in a common direction over a macroscopic volume called\\ndomain. The explanation of this cooperative effect requires quantum\\nmechanics and is beyond the scope of this textbook. Each domain has a\\nnet magnetisation. Typical domain size is 1mm and the domain contains\\nabout 1011 atoms. In the first instant, the magnetisation varies randomly\\nfrom domain to domain and there is no bulk magnetisation. This is shown\\nin Fig. 5.8(a). When we apply an external magnetic field B0, the domains\\norient themselves in the direction of B0 and simultaneously the domain\\noriented in the direction of B0 grow in size. This existence of domains and\\ntheir motion in B0 are not speculations. One may observe this under a\\nmicroscope after sprinkling a liquid suspension of powdered\\nferromagnetic substance of samples. This motion of suspension can be\\nobserved. Fig. 5.8(b) shows the situation when the domains have aligned\\nand amalgamated to form a single ‘giant’ domain.\\n Thus, in a ferromagnetic material the field lines are highly\\nconcentrated. In non-uniform magnetic field, the sample tends to move\\ntowards the region of high field. We may wonder as to what happens\\nwhen the external field is removed. In some ferromagnetic materials the\\nmagnetisation persists. Such materials are called hard magnetic materials\\nor hard ferromagnets . Alnico, an alloy of iron, aluminium, nickel, cobalt\\nand copper, is one such material. The naturally occurring lodestone is\\nanother. Such materials form permanent magnets to be used among other\\nthings as a compass needle. On the other hand, there is a class of\\nferromagnetic materials in which the magnetisation disappears on removal\\nof the external field. Soft iron is one such material. Appropriately enough,\\nsuch materials are called soft ferromagnetic materials . There are a number\\nof elements, which are ferromagnetic: iron, cobalt, nickel, gadolinium,\\netc. The relative magnetic permeability is >1000!\\nThe ferromagnetic property depends on temperature. At high enough\\ntemperature, a ferromagnet becomes a paramagnet. The domain structure\\ndisintegrates with temperature.

Experimental observations\\ndiscussed in Section 6.2 can be explained using this concept.\\nThe motion of a magnet towards or away from coil C1 in\\nExperiment 6.1 and moving a current-carrying coil C2 towards\\nor away from coil C1 in Experiment 6.2, change the magnetic\\nflux associated with coil C1.  The change in magnetic flux induces\\nemf in coil C1. It was this induced emf which caused electric\\ncurrent to flow in coil C1 and thr ough the galvanometer . A\\nplausible explanation for the observations of Experiment 6.3 is\\nas follows: When the tapping key K is pressed, the current in\\ncoil C2 (and the resulting magnetic field) rises from zero to a\\nmaximum value in a short time. Consequently, the magnetic\\nflux through the neighbouring coil C1 also increases. It is the change in\\nmagnetic flux through coil C1 that produces an induced emf in coil C1.\\nWhen the key is held pressed, current in coil C2 is constant. Therefore,\\nthere is no change in the magnetic flux through coil C1 and the current in\\ncoil C1 drops to zero. When the key is released, the current in C2 and the\\nresulting magnetic field decreases from the maximum value to zero in a\\nshort time. This results in a decrease in magnetic flux through coil C1\\nand hence again induces an electric current in coil C1*. The common\\npoint in all these observations is that the time rate of change of magnetic\\nflux through a circuit induces emf in it. Faraday stated experimental\\nobservations in the form of a law called Faraday’s law of electromagnetic\\ninduction . The law is stated below.FIGURE  6.4 A plane of\\nsurface area A placed in a\\nuniform magnetic field B.\\nFIGURE  6.5 Magnetic field Bi\\nat the ith area element. d Ai\\nrepresents area vector of the\\nith area element.\\n*Note that sensitive electrical instruments in the vicinity of an electromagnet\\ncan be damaged due to the induced emfs (and the resulting currents)  when the\\nelectromagnet is turned on or off.\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

Hence current is\\ninduced in the coil in such a direction that it opposes the increase in flux.\\nThis is possible only if the current in the coil is in a counter -clockwise\\ndirection with respect to an observer situated on the side of the magnet.\\nNote that magnetic moment associated with this current has North polarity\\ntowards the North-pole of the approaching magnet. Similarly, if the North-\\npole of the magnet is being withdrawn from the coil, the magnetic flux\\nthrough the coil will decrease. To counter this decrease in magnetic flux,\\nthe induced current in the coil flows in clockwise direction and its South-\\npole faces the receding North-pole of the bar magnet. This would result in\\nan attractive force which opposes the motion of the magnet and the\\ncorresponding decrease in flux.\\nWhat will happen if an open circuit is used in place of the closed loop\\nin the above example? In this case too, an emf is induced across the open\\nends of the circuit. The direction of the induced emf can be found\\nusing Lenz’s law. Consider Figs. 6.6 (a) and (b). They provide an easier\\nway to understand the direction of induced currents. Note that the\\ndirection shown by  and  indicate the directions of the induced\\ncurrents.\\nA little reflection on this matter should convince us on the\\ncorrectness of Lenz’s law. Suppose that the induced current was in\\nthe direction opposite to the one depicted in Fig. 6.6(a). In that case,\\nthe South-pole due to the induced current will face the approaching\\nNorth-pole of the magnet. The bar magnet will then be attracted\\ntowards the coil at an ever increasing acceleration. A gentle push on\\nthe magnet will initiate the process and its velocity and kinetic energy\\nwill continuously increase without expending any energy. If this can\\nhappen, one could construct a perpetual-motion machine by a\\nsuitable arrangement. This violates the law of conservation of energy\\nand hence can not happen.\\nNow consider the correct case shown in Fig. 6.6(a). In this situation,\\nthe bar magnet experiences a repulsive force due to the induced\\ncurrent. Therefore, a person has to do work in moving the magnet.\\nWhere does the energy spent by the person go? This energy is\\ndissipated by Joule heating produced by the induced current.FIGURE  6.6\\nIllustration of\\nLenz’s law.\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

This\\nis a pot like surface [Fig. 8.1(b)] which nowhere touches the current, but\\nhas its bottom between the capacitor plates; its mouth is the circular\\nloop mentioned above. Another such surface is shaped like a tiffin box\\n(without the lid) [Fig. 8.1(c)]. On applying Ampere’s circuital law to such\\nsurfaces with the same perimeter , we find that the left hand side of\\nEq. (8.1) has not changed but the right hand side is zero and not m0i,\\nsince no current passes through the surface of Fig. 8.1(b) and (c). So we\\nhave a contradiction ; calculated one way, there is a magnetic field at a\\npoint P; calculated another way, the magnetic field at P is zero.\\nSince the contradiction arises from our use of Ampere’s circuital law,\\nthis law must be missing something. The missing term must be such\\nthat one gets the same magnetic field at point P ,  no matter what sur face\\nis used.\\nWe can actually guess the missing ter m by looking car efully at\\nFig. 8.1(c). Is there anything passing through the surface S between the\\nplates of the capacitor? Y es, of course, the electric field! If the plates of the\\ncapacitor have an area A, and a total charge Q, the magnitude of the\\nelectric field E between the plates is ( Q/A)/e0 (see Eq. 2.41). The field is\\nperpendicular to the surface S of Fig. 8.1(c). It has the same magnitude\\nover the area A of the capacitor plates, and vanishes outside it. So what\\nis the electric flux FE through the surface S ? Using Gauss’s law, it is\\nE\\n0 01= =Q QA AAΦε ε= E (8.3)\\nNow if the charge Q on the capacitor plates changes with time, there is a\\ncurrent i = (dQ/dt), so that using Eq.

If we generalise\\nthis law by adding to the total current carried by conductors through\\nthe surface, another term which is e0 times the rate of change of electric\\nflux through the same surface, the total has the same value of current i\\nfor all surfaces. If this is done, there is no contradiction in the value of B\\nobtained anywhere using the generalised Ampere’s law. B at the point P\\nis non-zero no matter which surface is used for calculating it. B at a\\npoint P outside the plates [Fig. 8.1(a)] is the same as at a point M just\\ninside, as it should be. The current carried by conductors due to flow of\\ncharges is called conduction current . The current, given by Eq. (8.4), is a\\nnew term, and is due to changing electric field (or electric displacement,\\nan old term still used sometimes). It is, therefore, called displacement\\ncurrent  or Maxwell’s displacement current. Figure 8.2 shows the electric\\nand magnetic fields inside the parallel plate capacitor discussed above.\\nThe generalisation made by Maxwell then is the following.

On the other hand, inside the capacitor , ther e is\\nno conduction current, i.e., ic = 0, and there is only displacement\\ncurrent, so that id = i.\\nThe generalised (and correct) Ampere’s circuital law has the same\\nform as Eq.

In some cases, for example, steady\\nelectric fields in a conducting wire, the displacement current may\\nbe zero since the electric field E does not change with time. In other\\ncases, for example, the charging capacitor above, both conduction\\nand displacement currents may be present in different regions of\\nspace. In most of the cases, they both may be present in the same\\nregion of space, as there exist no perfectly conducting or perfectly\\ninsulating medium. Most interestingly, there may be large regions\\nof space where there is no conduction current, but there is only a\\ndisplacement current due to time-varying electric fields. In such a\\nregion, we expect a magnetic field, though there is no (conduction)\\ncurrent source nearby! The prediction of such a displacement current\\ncan be verified experimentally. For example, a magnetic field (say at point\\nM) between the plates of the capacitor in Fig. 8.2(a) can be measured and\\nis seen to be the same as that just outside (at P).\\nThe displacement current has (literally) far reaching consequences.\\nOne thing we immediately notice is that the laws of electricity and\\nmagnetism are now more symmetrical *. Faraday’s law of induction states\\nthat there is an induced emf equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux.\\nNow, since the emf between two points 1 and 2 is the work done per unit\\ncharge in taking it from 1 to 2, the existence of an emf implies the existence\\nof an electric field. So, we can rephrase Faraday’s law of electromagnetic\\ninduction by saying that a magnetic field,  changing with time, gives rise\\nto an electric field. Then, the fact that an electric field  changing with\\ntime gives rise to a magnetic field,  is the symmetrical counterpart, and isFIGURE  8.2 (a) The\\nelectric and magnetic\\nfields E and B between\\nthe capacitor plates, at\\nthe point M.

His experiment, like that\\nof Hertz’s, was confined to the laboratory.\\nAt around the same time, Guglielmo Marconi in Italy\\nfollowed Hertz’s work and succeeded in transmitting\\nelectromagnetic waves over distances of many kilometres.\\nMarconi’s experiment marks the beginning of the field of\\ncommunication using electromagnetic waves.\\n8.3.2  Nature of electromagnetic waves\\nIt can be shown from Maxwell’s equations that electric\\nand magnetic fields in an electromagnetic wave are\\nperpendicular to each other , and to the dir ection of\\npropagation. It appears reasonable, say from our\\ndiscussion of the displacement current. Consider\\nFig. 8.2. The electric field inside the plates of the capacitor\\nis directed perpendicular to the plates. The magnetic\\nfield this gives rise to via the displacement current is\\nalong the perimeter of a circle parallel to the capacitor\\nplates. So B and E are perpendicular in this case. This\\nis a general feature.\\nIn Fig. 8.3, we show a typical example of a plane\\nelectromagnetic wave propagating along the z direction\\n(the fields are shown as a function of the z coordinate, at\\na given time t). The electric field Ex is along the x-axis,\\nand varies sinusoidally with z, at a given time. The\\nmagnetic field By is along the y-axis, and again varies\\nsinusoidally with z. The electric and magnetic fields Ex\\nand By are perpendicular to each\\nother , and to the dir ection z of\\npropagation. W e can write Ex and\\nBy as follows:\\nEx= E0 sin ( kz–wt)[8.7(a)]\\nBy= B0 sin ( kz–wt)[8.7(b)]\\nHere k is related to the wave length\\nl of the wave by the usual\\nequation\\n2kλπ= (8.8) EXAMPLE  8.1\\nHeinrich Rudolf Hertz\\n(1857 – 1894)  German\\nphysicist who was the\\nfirst to broadcast and\\nreceive radio waves.

The speed of propagation of the wave is ( ω/k).\\nUsing Eqs. [8.7(a) and (b)] for Ex and By  and Maxwell’s equations, one\\nfinds that\\nω = ck, where, c = 1/0 0µ ε [8.9(a)]\\nThe relation ω = ck is the standard one for waves (see for example,\\nSection 14.4 of class XI Physics textbook).

They differ from all the other waves we have\\nstudied so far, in respect that no material medium  is involved in the\\nvibrations of the electric and magnetic fields.\\nBut what if a material medium is actually there? We know that light,\\nan electromagnetic wave, does propagate through glass, for example. We\\nhave seen earlier that the total electric and magnetic fields inside a\\nmedium are described in terms of a permittivity ε and a magnetic\\npermeability µ (these describe the factors  by which the total fields differ\\nfrom the external fields). These replace ε0 and µ0 in the description to\\nelectric and magnetic fields in Maxwell’s equations with the result that in\\na material medium of permittivity ε and magnetic permeability µ, the\\nvelocity of light becomes,\\n1v\\nµε=(8.11)\\nThus, the velocity of light depends on electric and magnetic properties of\\nthe medium. We shall see in the next chapter that the refractive index  of\\none medium with respect to the other is equal to the ratio of velocities of\\nlight in the two media.\\nThe velocity of electromagnetic waves in free space or vacuum is an\\nimportant fundamental constant. It has been shown by experiments on\\nelectromagnetic waves of different wavelengths that this velocity is the\\nsame (independent of wavelength) to within a few metres per second, out\\nof a value of 3 ×108 m/s. The constancy of the velocity of em waves in\\nvacuum is so strongly supported by experiments and the actual value is\\nso well known now that this is used to define a standard of length .\\nThe great technological importance of electromagnetic waves stems\\nfrom their capability to carry energy from one place to another.

We\\nnow know that, e lectrom agnetic  waves include visible light waves, X-rays,\\ngamma rays, radio waves, microwaves, ultraviolet and infrared waves. The\\nclassification of em waves according to frequency is the electromagnetic\\nspectrum (Fig. 8. 4). There is no sharp division between one kind of wave\\nand the next . The classification is based roughly on how the waves are\\nproduced and/or detected.\\nWe briefly describe these different types of electromagnetic waves, in\\norder of decreasing wavelengths.Electromagnetic spectrumhttp://www.fnal.gov/pub/inquiring/more/light\\nhttp://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

They are used in radio and television communication systems. They\\nare generally in the frequency range from 500 kHz to about 1000 MHz.\\nThe AM (amplitude modulated) band is from 530 kHz to 1710 kHz. Higher\\nfrequencies upto 54 MHz are used for short wave  bands. TV waves range\\nfrom 54 MHz to 890 MHz. The FM (frequency modulated) radio band\\nextends from 88 MHz to 108 MHz. Cellular phones use radio waves to\\ntransmit voice communication in the ultrahigh frequency (UHF) band.

This band\\nlies adjacent to the low-frequency or long-wave length end of the visible\\nspectrum. Infrared waves are sometimes referred to as heat waves . This\\nis because water molecules present in most materials readily absorb\\ninfrared waves (many other molecules, for example, CO2, NH3, also absorb\\ninfrared waves). After absorption, their thermal motion increases, that is,\\nthey heat up and heat their surroundings. Infrared lamps are used in\\nphysical therapy. Infrared radiation also plays an important role in\\nmaintaining the earth’s warmth or average temperature through the\\ngreenhouse effect. Incoming visible light (which passes relatively easily\\nthrough the atmosphere) is absorbed by the earth’s surface and re-\\nradiated as infrared (longer wavelength) radiations. This radiation is\\ntrapped by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and water vapour .\\nInfrared detectors are used in Earth satellites, both for military purposes\\nand to observe growth of crops. Electronic devices (for example\\nsemiconductor light emitting diodes) also   emit infrared and are widely\\nused in the remote switches of household electronic systems such as TV\\nsets, video recorders and hi-fi systems.\\n8.4.4 Visible rays\\nIt is the most familiar form of electromagnetic waves. It is the part of the\\nspectrum that is detected by the human eye. It runs from about\\n4 × 1014 Hz to about 7 × 1014\\n Hz or a wavelength range of about 700 –\\n400 nm. Visible light emitted or reflected from objects around us provides\\nus information about the world. Our eyes are sensitive to this range of\\nwavelengths. Different animals are sensitive to different range of\\nwavelengths. For example, snakes can detect infrared waves, and the\\n‘visible’ range of many insects extends well into the utraviolet.\\n8.4.5 Ultraviolet rays\\nIt covers wavelengths ranging from about 4 × 10–7 m (400 nm) down to\\n6 × 10–10m (0.6 nm). Ultraviolet ( UV) radiation is produced by special\\nlamps and very hot bodies. The sun is an important source of ultraviolet\\nlight. But fortunately, most of it is absorbed in the ozone layer in the\\natmosphere at an altitude of about 40 – 50 km. UV light in large quantities\\nhas harmful effects on humans. Exposure to UV radiation induces the\\nproduction of more melanin, causing tanning of the skin. UV radiation is\\nabsorbed by ordinary glass. Hence, one cannot get tanned or sunburn\\nthrough glass windows.\\nWelders wear special glass goggles or face masks with glass windows\\nto protect their eyes from large amount of UV produced by welding arcs.\\nDue to its  shorter wavelengths, UV radiations  can be focussed into very\\nnarrow beams for high precision applications such as  LASIK ( Laser-\\nassisted in situ keratomileusis ) eye surgery. UV lamps are used to kill\\ngerms  in water purifiers.\\nOzone layer in the atmosphere plays a protective role, and hence its\\ndepletion by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) gas (such as freon) is a matter\\nof international concern.\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",
